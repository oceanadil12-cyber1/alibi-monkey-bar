# Project Scope — Alibi Monkey Bar Website & Web App

**Version:** 3.0
**Date:** October 1, 2026
**Client:** Georgie's Alibi Monkey Bar
**Location:** 2266 Wilton Drive, Wilton Manors, FL 33305
**Repository:** Private — github.com/oceanadil12-cyber1/alibi-monkey-bar

---

## 1. Project Overview

A complete website and web application for Georgie's Alibi Monkey Bar — a
restaurant, bar, and live entertainment venue in Wilton Manors, South Florida.

The project delivers three integrated systems:

1. **Public Website** — a fast, hand-built site for guests (menu, events,
   entertainment, reservations, contact, gallery)
2. **AI Chat Assistant** — a conversational assistant on every page that answers
   guest questions and can take food orders
3. **Admin Panel** — a password-protected back office for the restaurant team to
   manage orders, guests, events, and site content
4. **Kitchen Display System (KDS)** — a real-time order display for kitchen staff

**Tech stack:** Plain HTML, CSS, vanilla JavaScript (no build step, no framework).
PHP 7.4+ backend with a MySQL 8 database (MariaDB 10.2+ also works) for orders,
reservations, messages, newsletter sign-ups, chats, the activity log and settings.
Menu data and page content stay in files (JSON, Markdown, HTML).

---

## 2. Public Website

### 2.1 Pages

| Page | File | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Home** | `index.html` | Hero image slider, upcoming-events slider, awards section, Google reviews widget, Instagram feed |
| **Menu & Ordering** | `menu.html` | Live menu from Square, full cart and checkout, pickup/delivery, card or cash payment |
| **Events** | `events.html` | Weekly entertainment lineup with day tabs (opens on today), one-night specials with auto-expiry |
| **Entertainment** | `entertainment.html` | Shows and performers overview |
| **Performers** | `performers.html` | Individual performer profiles with photos and show schedules |
| **Dancers** | `dancers.html` | Dancer roster with photos |
| **Gallery** | `gallery.html` | Instagram feed with paginated "See More Posts" loading |
| **Private Events** | `private-events.html` | Event hosting packages and enquiry information |
| **About** | `about.html` | Venue story and award recognitions |
| **Contact** | `contact.html` | Contact form, reservation request form, interactive map, hours |
| **404** | `404.html` | Branded error page |

### 2.2 Design & Performance

- **Responsive:** mobile-first, works on phones, tablets, and desktop
- **Images:** all WebP format, served in 3 widths (640/1024/1600) via `srcset`
- **Fonts:** self-hosted Inter and Playfair Display (woff2, no external requests)
- **Icons:** inline SVG masks (not Font Awesome), defined in `css/style.css`
- **Lazy loading:** images and Elfsight widgets load on scroll
- **Caching:** long-lived browser cache with `?v=YYYYMMDD` cache-busting
- **No build step:** what is in the repository is exactly what is uploaded to the server

### 2.3 Third-Party Widgets

- **Elfsight:** Google reviews widget and Instagram feed
- **Square Web Payments SDK:** hosted payment field on the menu page (card details never touch the server)

---

## 3. Online Ordering System

**Files:** `menu.html`, `js/order.js`, `api/menu.php`, `api/checkout.php`, `api/menu-overrides.php`

### 3.1 Menu

- Live menu fetched from the restaurant's Square Online store via `api/menu.php`
- Cached for 15 minutes; falls back to `data/menu.json` if Square is unreachable
- Categories, items with photos, sizes/variations, and modifier options
- Admin can hide items, change prices, edit descriptions, and add custom dishes

### 3.2 Cart & Checkout Flow

1. Guest browses menu by category, taps items to add to cart
2. Items with options (sizes, extras) show a selection modal
3. Cart persists in `localStorage` across page refreshes
4. Guest chooses **Pickup** or **Delivery** fulfillment
5. Delivery validates ZIP code against allowed area, enforces minimum subtotal
6. Server re-prices every item from the live menu (tamper-proof)
7. Tax, delivery fee, and tip are calculated server-side
8. Card payment processed through Square Web Payments SDK
9. **Cash-on-delivery mode:** when no Square payment credentials are configured, the system accepts orders without card payment — guests pay in cash

### 3.3 Per-Item Rules (set via Admin Panel)

- **Pickup only:** item cannot be ordered for delivery
- **Delivery only:** item cannot be ordered for pickup
- **Delivery surcharge:** extra fee for delivery orders
- **Custom prep time:** overrides the default preparation time

### 3.4 Server-Side Safety

- Every item and option re-priced from the live menu
- Items no longer on the menu are rejected
- Orders capped at 50 line items
- Required options enforced
- Fulfillment type restrictions enforced
- Idempotency key prevents double-charging on retries

---

## 4. AI Chat Assistant

**Files:** `js/chat.js`, `api/chat.php`, `api/chat-claude.php`, `api/chat-order.php`, `api/chat-cards.php`, `api/chat-log.php`, `api/chat-insights.php`, `data/chatbot-knowledge.md`

### 4.1 Overview

A floating "Ask us" chat button appears on every page. The assistant answers
guest questions about hours, events, the menu, reservations, private events,
and more in natural language.

### 4.2 Knowledge Sources

| Topic | Source | Update method |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Hours, policies, reservations, FAQs | `data/chatbot-knowledge.md` | Admin Panel → Knowledge |
| Weekly show lineup | `events.html` | Admin Panel → Events |
| Happy Hour and drinks | `menu.html` | Edit page / Admin |
| Food menu, prices, pickup/delivery | Square | Change in Square |
| Current time and tonight's shows | Injected per request | Automatic |

### 4.3 AI Providers

- **Free tier:** Groq, Gemini, Mistral (rate-limited)
- **Local:** Ollama (for development and testing)
- **Paid:** Claude via Anthropic API (requires PHP 8.1+)
- **Fallback chain:** if one provider fails, the next in `chat_fallback` is tried

### 4.4 Food Ordering via Chat

The AI uses an `add_to_order` tool to add dishes to the guest's cart directly
from the conversation. It matches dish, size, and option names against the live
menu. Ambiguous or missing items are asked back. The chat shares the same cart
as `menu.html` — guests click "Review & pay" to open the normal checkout.

### 4.5 Interactive Cards & Suggestions

Replies include:
- **Show cards** with poster, time, and host
- **Party package cards** for private events
- **Food order cards** for items added to cart
- Up to 3 follow-up suggestion buttons

### 4.6 Protections

- Same-site JSON only
- 30 messages per visitor per 10 minutes
- `chat_daily_limit` caps total messages per day site-wide (default 500)
- Chat history saved in the database (`chat_sessions`, `chat_messages`)

---

4. Submit the order — it appears on the **KDS** automatically
5. Order is recorded as a dine-in type with the table number

---

## 8. Backend Architecture

### 8.1 API Endpoints

| Endpoint | Method | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `api/menu.php` | GET | Live menu from Square (cached 15 min) |
| `api/checkout.php` | POST | Validate cart, calculate totals, charge card |
| `api/chat.php` | POST | AI chat assistant |
| `api/contact.php` | POST | Contact and reservation form submissions |

| `api/happy-hour.php` | GET/POST | Happy Hour data read/write |
| `api/kds.php` | POST | KDS order management and settings |
| `api/chats.php` | — | Legacy redirect to Admin Panel |

### 8.2 Data Storage (MySQL + files)

Tables are created by `api/setup.sql`; the connection lives in `api/db.php`
(login in `api/config.php`, `db_*`). Times are stored in New York time.

| Data | Format | Location |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Orders (online + dine-in), with status, notes and KDS times | MySQL | `orders` table |
| Chat logs | MySQL | `chat_sessions` + `chat_messages` tables |
| Contact form submissions | MySQL | `contacts` table |
| Reservation requests | MySQL | `reservations` table |
| Newsletter subscribers | MySQL | `subscribers` table |
| "Call a waiter" requests | MySQL | `waiter_calls` table |
| Admin activity log | MySQL | `admin_activity` table |
| KDS settings, Happy Hour, menu overrides, store settings | MySQL (JSON values) | `settings` table |
| Guest records kept while the database is down | JSONL | `api/data/unsaved/` (moved in from the admin dashboard) |
| Events | JSON | `api/data/events.json` |
| Menu cache | JSON | `api/cache/menu.json` |
| Rate-limit counters | JSON | `api/cache/rate/` |
| Geo cache | JSON | `api/cache/geo/` |
| Chatbot knowledge | Markdown | `data/chatbot-knowledge.md` |

### 8.3 Shared Libraries

- `api/lib.php` — config loading, Square API calls, JSON responses, same-site checks, rate limiting, CSV handling, email, caching
- `admin/inc/store.php` — data access layer for orders, metadata, events
- `admin/inc/bootstrap.php` — admin panel initialization
- `admin/inc/auth.php` — session and authentication
- `admin/inc/layout.php` — admin page shell, sidebar, navigation
- `admin/inc/ui.php` — shared admin UI components

---

## 9. Security Summary

| Layer | Measures |
| --- | --- |
| **Server files** | `.htaccess` blocks `config.php`, `lib.php`, `cache/`, `data/`, `.md` files, dot-files, `.git` |
| **API endpoints** | Same-site JSON POST only, rate-limited |
| **Payments** | Server re-prices every item; card details go to Square's hosted field (never touch this server); idempotency keys |
| **Admin Panel** | Password, session cookies (HttpOnly, SameSite), CSRF tokens, rate-limited login, CSP headers, noindex, no-cache |
| **KDS** | Same protections as Admin (separate session), X-Frame-Options DENY |
| **User input** | HTML-escaped everywhere; spreadsheet exports neutralise formulas |
| **Chat** | 30 msg/visitor/10min, daily site-wide limit, auto-delete logs after 120 days |
| **Secrets** | `api/config.php` is git-ignored; never committed |

---
