# Deployment

The site is built for a standard **Apache / cPanel host with PHP 8.1+ and a MySQL
database** (MySQL 8.0.13+ or MariaDB 10.2+), which is how most shared hosting,
including a hosting.com reseller account, is set up. The `.htaccess` files handle
security, caching, clean URLs and the 404 page. It runs at a domain's root or in
a subfolder (`https://example.com/alibi/`): every link and rule works out the
site's own folder.

## What to upload

**Easiest:** double-click `Make Upload Package.bat`. It builds the folder
`Alibi Website - For Developer` next to the repository with one ZIP,
`alibi-website-upload.zip` (exactly the files for the server), plus the
step-by-step guide `HOW-TO-GO-LIVE.md` (the same text as [GO-LIVE.md](GO-LIVE.md)).
Hand that folder to whoever puts the site live.

The ZIP also carries **`api/site-settings.php`**, made from this computer's
`api/config.php` by `make-site-settings.php`: the admin password, the notification
email and the chat assistant's provider and keys. Left out: the database login
(each server connects its own), `data_dir`, the Ollama settings (this computer
only) and a Gmail-type `from_email` (the server sends as `website@its-domain`).
So the package is **private**: send it only to the person putting the site live.
`api/.htaccess` blocks the file from the web.

Uploading by hand instead: upload the **contents** of this repository to the web
root (usually `public_html/`), **except**:

| Don't upload | Why |
| --- | --- |
| `.git/` | Repository history. It's also blocked by `.htaccess` as a safety net |
| `docs/`, `README.md` | Developer notes. `.md` files are blocked anyway |
| `*.bat`, `*.ps1`, `make-site-settings.php`, `.gitignore`, `.gitattributes` | Only used on your own computer |

Must upload: all `*.html`, `404.php`, `css/`, `js/`, `images/`, `fonts/`, `data/`,
`api/`, `admin/`, `kds/`, `dine-in/`, every `.htaccess` and `robots.txt`. Without
the package, create `api/site-settings.php` from `api/config.example.php` (or put
the same settings in `api/config.php`).

> Dot-files like `.htaccess` are hidden by default in some FTP programs and in
> the cPanel File Manager. Turn on "show hidden files" and make sure they get uploaded.

## Settings: three layers

`config()` in `api/lib.php` reads, first one wins:

1. `api/config.php`: this server's own settings. The admin panel's first-run
   screen writes the `db_*` values here (keeping any earlier file beside it as
   `api/.config-before-<date>.php`). A blank value counts as not set.
2. `api/site-settings.php`: the owner's settings from the upload package.
3. The defaults in `config()`.

## First-time setup

1. **Upload** the ZIP and *Extract* it (cPanel File Manager), or upload by hand as above.
2. **Create the database.** On a hosting.com reseller account, first create the
   site's own cPanel account in WHM, then log in to that cPanel:
   1. *MySQL Databases* → create a database (cPanel names it like `cpuser_alibi`).
   2. On the same page, create a user with a long generated password, then
      *Add User to Database* with **All Privileges**.
3. **Connect it.** Open `/admin/` and sign in. While the database isn't connected
   (or stops answering), the panel shows **Connect the database**: enter the
   name, user and password. It tests them, creates the 10 tables from
   `api/setup.sql` and saves them in `api/config.php`. It explains a wrong
   password, a wrong name or missing privileges in plain words. If the user has no
   CREATE rights, *phpMyAdmin* → the database → *Import* → `api/setup.sql` does the
   same, then connect again.
4. **Enable HTTPS.** Once the SSL certificate is active (usually free with
   AutoSSL in cPanel), turn on cPanel → *Domains* → *Force HTTPS Redirect*, or
   uncomment the five HTTPS lines in the root `.htaccess`.
5. **robots.txt**: once the site is live, add the `Sitemap:` line with the real
   domain if you create a sitemap.
6. **Card payments** (later, optional): the site launches as cash on delivery.
   For Square, add the keys (see [ORDERING-SETUP.md](../ORDERING-SETUP.md)) and
   set `checkout_mode` to `card`.
7. **Chat assistant**: see below.

**Backups:** cPanel → *Backup* → *Download a MySQL Database Backup* (or phpMyAdmin →
*Export*) saves every order, reservation, message and chat. Take one before each
update and now and then.

## Chat assistant on the live site

Shared hosting can't run an AI model itself, so the live site uses a cloud AI.

**Free options (Mistral, Groq, Gemini):** the upload package carries the chat
settings from your local `api/config.php` (`chat_provider`, `chat_fallback` and
the keys) in `api/site-settings.php`, so there is nothing to copy. No Composer is needed. Use a
Groq account in the restaurant's name, and turn on Zero Data Retention in the
Groq console (Settings → Data Controls). The free plans allow a few questions
per minute across all the fallbacks. Check the chat history
(Admin → Conversations) now and then. If guests often hit the limit, switch to a paid plan.

**Paid option (Claude):**

1. The restaurant creates an account at <https://console.anthropic.com>,
   adds a card, buys some credit and **sets a monthly spend limit**. Then it
   creates an API key.
2. Check the host runs **PHP 8.1 or newer** (cPanel → *Select PHP Version*).
3. Install the Anthropic SDK: in cPanel's *Terminal*, `cd public_html/api`
   and run `composer require anthropic-ai/sdk`. Without Terminal, run
   the same command in `api/` on your computer and upload the `api/vendor/`
   folder it creates.
4. In your local `api/config.php`, set `'chat_provider' => 'claude'`, paste the key into
   `'anthropic_api_key'` and choose `'claude_model'`, then build and upload a new package (or put the same lines in the server's `api/config.php`).
5. Ask the chat a few questions on the live site. Check the replies in the
   chat history (Admin → Conversations), which also shows the token counts behind the bill.

`chat_daily_limit` in `config.php` caps how many messages the site answers per
day (default 500), so spam can't run up the bill.

## Admin panel on the live site

The admin password is your local `admin_password` (or the older `chat_admin_password`),
carried by the package; it must be long (12+ characters). Open `https://DOMAIN/admin/`. Keep the password private: the panel shows every
order, message and conversation, and can change the menu and the website. Turn on
HTTPS first (step 4 above) so the password isn't sent in the clear. The panel is
never indexed and needs no other setup; see [ADMIN.md](ADMIN.md).

`notify_email` comes from the package too, so new orders and messages are emailed
as well as shown in the panel. Leave `from_email` empty (the site sends as
`website@` its own domain) or set it to a mailbox on that domain.

**Events** are published by the panel by rewriting part of `events.html` and saving
posters in `images/events/`, so those two must be writable by the website (they
are on ordinary cPanel hosting). **Never upload your own copy of `events.html` or
`images/events/` over the live ones** once the team is using the panel.

## Updating the live site

1. Make and preview the change locally.
2. If CSS or JS changed, bump `?v=` in the pages (see the Content Guide).
3. Commit to git: `git add -A && git commit -m "Describe the change" && git push`
4. Upload **only the changed files** to the server, overwriting the old ones.

**Never overwrite on the server:** `api/config.php` (live keys and the database
login), the live database (never import a local copy over it), `api/data/` (sign-ins
and what the admin panel saves), `api/cache/`, `events.html`, `performers.html`, `images/events/`, `images/performers/` and
`data/chatbot-knowledge.md` (the team changes them from the panel). A new package's
`api/site-settings.php` may replace the old one: it carries your current local settings. Re-importing
`api/setup.sql` is safe: it only adds tables that are missing.

## Other hosting

- **Nginx or hosts without `.htaccess`:** recreate the rules yourself. Deny
  `api/config.php`, `api/site-settings.php`, `api/lib.php`, `api/cache/`, `api/data/`, `admin/inc/` and
  `/.git`, make `index.php` the index of `admin/`, and set `data_dir` in
  `config.php` to a folder outside the web root.
- **Static-only hosts (Netlify Drop, GitHub Pages):** the pages display, but
  the live menu, ordering and forms need PHP and won't work. That's fine for a
  design preview only. Don't use GitHub Pages on this private repository, because
  the published site would be public.
