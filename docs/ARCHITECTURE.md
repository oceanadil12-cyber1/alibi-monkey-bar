# Architecture

How the Alibi Monkey Bar website is put together.

## Overview

```
Browser ──► static pages (HTML/CSS/JS/images)          served as plain files
   │
   ├──► api/menu.php ──► Square Online store feed      live menu (cached 15 min)
   │         └─ fallback: data/menu.json
   ├──► api/checkout.php ──► Square Orders + Payments API
   ├──► api/contact.php ──► api/data/*.csv + email
   ├──► api/subscribe.php ──► api/data/newsletter.csv + Square Customers
   ├──► api/chat.php ──► Ollama (local testing) or Claude API (live)
   │         └─ facts: data/chatbot-knowledge.md + events.html + menu.html + Square menu
   │
   ├──► Square Web Payments SDK (card field, loaded on the menu page)
   └──► Elfsight widgets (Google reviews, Instagram feed)
```

There is **no build step**. What's in the repository is exactly what gets
uploaded to the server.

## Pages

Every page is a standalone HTML file with the same header, navigation and
footer, copied into each page. **Change the header or footer on every page**
when you edit them.

| File | Scripts loaded | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `index.html` | `main.js`, `elfsight-badge.js`, `upcoming.js` | Hero slider; upcoming-events slider built from `events.html` |
| `menu.html` | `main.js`, `order.js` | Ordering UI renders into `#order-menu` |
| `events.html` | `main.js`, `events.js` | The single source of the weekly lineup |
| `gallery.html` | `main.js`, `instagram-more.js` | Instagram feed through Elfsight |
| `contact.html` | `main.js` | Forms post to `api/contact.php` |
| other pages | `main.js` | Static content |

## JavaScript (`js/`)

| File | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `main.js` | Shared by every page: header style on scroll, mobile nav, hero slider, lazy loading for background images and Elfsight widgets, and AJAX form submission (any `<form data-endpoint="…">`) |
| `order.js` | The whole ordering flow: menu, item options, cart (saved in `localStorage` as `alibi-cart-v1`), pickup/delivery, tip, quote and Square card payment |
| `events.js` | Turns the weekly lineup on `events.html` into day tabs and opens on today's day in restaurant time (America/New_York) |
| `upcoming.js` | Home page slider. It fetches `events.html`, reads the lineup and shows events starting with the next one. It pauses on hover and respects reduced motion |
| `instagram-more.js` | Gallery paging: shows 20 posts, then 8 more per click |
| `elfsight-badge.js` | Tidies the Elfsight widget badge |
| `chat.js` | Loaded on every page. Adds the "Ask us" chat button and panel, which post to `api/chat.php`. The conversation is kept for the browser tab (`sessionStorage`, `alibi-chat-v1`). Dishes ordered in the chat go into the same cart as `order.js` (through `window.alibiOrder`, or `localStorage` on other pages) |

All scripts are plain ES2017+ with no dependencies. Each one checks for its
container element and exits quietly on pages that don't have it.

## CSS (`css/style.css`)

One stylesheet for the whole site:

- `@font-face` rules for the self-hosted fonts in `fonts/`
- the layout and components for every page
- **icons**: classes like `fas fa-phone` are *not* Font Awesome. Each one is
  defined near the end of the file as an inline SVG mask. To add an icon, copy
  an existing rule and paste in the new SVG path.

## Images (`images/`)

| Folder | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| `images/site/` | Photos in three widths (`-640`, `-1024`, `-1600`) used with `srcset` |
| `images/events/` | Event posters (480×600) |
| `images/dancers/` | Dancer photos (600×600) |
| `images/` | Logo, hero banners, award badges, favicons |

All photos are **WebP**. Keep the `width`/`height` attributes on `<img>` tags
so the page doesn't jump while images load.

## Back end (`api/`)

PHP with no framework and no database. See [API.md](API.md) for each endpoint.

- `lib.php` holds the shared helpers: config loading, Square requests, JSON
  responses, same-site checks, rate limiting, CSV saving, email and caching.
- `config.php` (private, not in git) holds the Square credentials and email settings.
- `cache/` is created automatically for the menu cache and rate-limit counters.
- `data/` is created automatically for the form submission CSVs.

## Security

- `api/.htaccess` blocks `config.php`, `lib.php`, `cache/` and `data/` from the web.
- The root `.htaccess` blocks `.md` files, dot-files and the `.git` folder,
  disables directory listings and sets security headers.
- The endpoints only accept same-site JSON POSTs and are rate-limited.
- Checkout **re-prices every cart item on the server** from the live menu, so
  a tampered browser can't change prices.
- Card details go straight into Square's hosted field and never touch this server.
